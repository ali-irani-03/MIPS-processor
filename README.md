# MIPS Processor Implementation in Verilog
## Overview
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a MIPS processor, along with a testbench to verify its functionality. The project was developed as part of a university project

## Features
- A fully functional MIPS processor implemented in Verilog
- Supports a subset of MIPS instructions
- Includes a testbench to verify the processor's functionality
- Written in Verilog HDL 
## Example
The binary instructions needed to calculate a multiplication and a factorial are written in the [instruction_memory.v](instruction_memory.v) file.
